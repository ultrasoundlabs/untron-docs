# Untron Core in one breath

Now, let's clean up some accumulated confusion about what Untron Core does and how it works.

Untron Core is a smart contract that manages peer-to-peer (P2P) orders between USDT on Tron and its native chain—in our case, ZKsync Era. The orders are P2P because technically people buy and sell USDT for USDT from each other, just on the different chains. To verify the fact of USDT transfer on Tron network, Untron Core utilizes ZK proofs of Untron Program.

Untron Core natively supports swaps between USDT (used as liquidity) and other tokens through 1inch Aggregator, and cross-chain transfers of these tokens through Across Bridge. This way, as long as there's a way to initiate an _untron swap_ on ZKsync Era, users can untron into any token on virtually any chain of the Ethereum ecosystem.

_(from [IUntronTransfers.sol](../contracts/src/interfaces/IUntronTransfers.sol))_

To prevent order spamming, Untron Core implements a collateral system, where each order creator is required to send a certain amount of collateral to the contract. This collateral is slashed and sent to the Core controller if the funds for the order were not sent to the receiver and the order wasn't stopped by the creator before expiration (5 minutes).

Untron team aims for the collateral size to be roughly equal to the opportunity cost of creating the order. That is, it's expected to be close to what all parties in the protocol would earn if the created order was properly executed.

```solidity
function requiredCollateral() external view returns (uint256);
```

### Untron is B2B or why collateral is a good UX

It's important to keep in mind that Untron is a B2B protocol. In other words, Untron _Core_ is not intended for end-users to interact with. Instead, various projects integrating Untron will provide necessary infrastructure for their users to interact with the protocol. For example, the project provides collateral itself and might decide to automatically stop all its unexecuted orders after 3 minutes, rather than 5, to keep their collateral.

The best, albeit not the most obvious, example of such integration is [Untron.finance](https://untron.finance)—the official frontend for Untron, built by Untron team. Untron.finance provides a straightforward interface to swap between USDT Tron from any wallet and chain without any collateral. Instead, it uses advanced internal logic to rate-limit dishonest users and prevent them from spamming orders. Therefore, from the technical point of view, Untron.finance is just one of the projects that utilizes Untron for its operations. If Untron.finance goes down, users can come to an alternative frontend, when such will be made, or use projects that integrate Untron directly—[Clave](https://getclave.com), [Daimo](https://daimo.com), [Peanut](https://peanut.to), and more—to perform swaps through them.

## Intron Swaps

_TODO: In the first iteration of Untron, Untron V1 was used to perform swaps in both sides. We implemented Untron Intents, a second, multi-chain protocol in the Untron ecosystem, that significantly improved UX for intron swaps. However, its documentation is still in progress. If you want to learn more about them now, please reach out to us._
